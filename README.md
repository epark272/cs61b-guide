There are countless numbers of wikis and guides for learning data structures and algorithms -- **this is not one of them**. This site is intended to help students with practical examples of exam, discussion, homework, and lab assignments. I provide walkthroughs, code examples, and general guiding tips to help you get through the semester more easily!

A note on target audience: these guides are designed for students who come into CS 61B with 1 semester of programming experience and no prior experience with Java. If this sounds like you, this is the perfect resource for you! If you are more experienced, you may find the pace of these guides to be a bit slow or over-explained. Feel free to jump around at your own pace, or just cherry pick the exercises that you might be having some trouble with.



This website is still in its very early stages! You may encounter pages that have no content or are not done yet. I'm starting to populate the site with lab first, then homework. Then I'll move on to exam/discussion content.
